# Chimeraspace
## Description
This project entails a practice shooting range project called "Chimeraspace", where the user can aim train by shooting targets, test out different guns and gun attachments, fight various enemies, and test out different player movement and combat abilities. This project is paused due to recent Unity changes. A transfer to Unreal Engine 5 is pending.
